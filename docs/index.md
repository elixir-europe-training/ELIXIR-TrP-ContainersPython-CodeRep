## Lesson overview

!!! overview ""
    :fontawesome-regular-bookmark: **Description**  
   This course explores several different approaches to provide an end user with a software environment that ensures successful execution of scientific analysis software in a reproducible manner. It then focuses upon an examplar - Software Containers (Specifically implemented using Docker).

    
    <br>
    :fontawesome-solid-arrow-left: **Prerequisites**  
    To be able to follow this course, learners should have knowledge in:  

    1. Familiarity with using a text editor to create and edit plain ASCII text files.   
    2. Basic experience in using command-line Linux.   
    3. Additionally, students will find it beneficial to have an overview of how software is installed under Linux.   



    :fontawesome-solid-arrow-right: **Learning Outcomes:**  
    By the end of the course, learners will be able to:  

    1. State several approaches to reproducible software environments and critically debate the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.    
    2. Identify the roles of particular commands in a Dockerfile and create simple functional Docker containers.

## Setup

### Data setup
To run this lesson you need to install code and data from [here](https://github.com/elixir-europe-training/ELIXIR-TrP-CodeRep-Example-Python )

### Software setup
To run this course you need to install Docker on your computer [Instructions here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and have access to a text editor program that can edit and save ASCII text documents (Not a word processor like Word).   
NB Course examples assume an Intel architecture computer (i386). The author has ssucessfully run the exercises on an Apple Silicon Macintosh
 by creating a UTM Debian linux Virtual machine with Intel emulation.
